# IAM

## üìå Summary
Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls user access to AWS services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Features
- Fine-grained permissions via policies
- IAM users, groups, and roles
- Support for MFA
- Temporary credentials via STS

## üîó Integrations
- [[EC2]], [[S3]], [[CloudWatch]]

## üìò Use Cases
- Assign EC2 roles to access S3 buckets
- Enforce MFA for sensitive operations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls
- Overly permissive policies (use least privilege)
- Confusing roles with users

## üîÅ Linked Notes
- [[Global-Infrastructure]]

## üß™ Practice Question
> What‚Äôs the difference between an IAM role and an IAM user?

# Global-Infrastructure.md
cat <<EOF > "$VAULT_DIR/00-Foundation/Global-Infrastructure.md"
# Global Infrastructure

## üìå Summary
AWS is built on a global network of Regions, Availability Zones (AZs), and Edge Locations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Features
- Regions are isolated locations
- AZs provide high availability within regions
- Edge locations used by CloudFront for caching

## üîó Integrations
- [[S3]], [[Route-53]], [[EC2]]

## üìò Use Cases
- Deploying across AZs for resilience
- Using edge locations for low-latency content delivery

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls
- Assuming all services are available in all regions
- Confusing regional vs. global services

## üîÅ Linked Notes
- [[IAM]]

## üß™ Practice Question
> Why is it important to architect for multiple AZs in the same region?

## üìå Summary
Brief overview of the service or concept.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Features
- Bullet points of key features
- Limits or constraints
- Pricing model

## üîó Integrations
- Works with: [[IAM]], [[VPC]], [[CloudWatch]]

## üìò Use Cases
- Real-world scenarios

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls
- Misconfigurations or assumptions

## üß™ Practice Question
> Add a representative sample question here

## üí≠ Possible Implementation Notes
- Notes about how AWS might implement this behind the scenes (e.g., global DNS strategies, S3 internals, load balancer behavior)

# AWS Solutions Architect Vault

This is a personal knowledge vault designed to support my study and certification as an **AWS Certified Solutions Architect**, using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for structured, interlinked note-taking.

It is built to complement the [AWS SkillBuilder](https://skillbuilder.aws) coursework, real-world architecture patterns, and exam preparation strategies. Notes are organized by AWS domains and services, with templates, integration links, and embedded practice questions.

> Use this vault as both a study companion and a reusable reference for cloud architecture and AWS services.

## üìò Note Format

Notes follow a consistent template that includes:
- Summary
- Core Features
- Integrations
- Use Cases
- Common Pitfalls
- Sample Questions
- **Implementation Notes** (to speculate or learn how AWS likely implements services internally)

## ‚úÖ Version Control

This vault is Git version-controlled so I can:
- Track study progress
- Back up and sync across machines
- Branch into deep dives on specialty topics

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Open it in Obsidian
3. Use the template in \`Templates/Topic-Note-Template.md\` for every AWS service you learn
