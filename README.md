# AWS Solutions Architect Vault

This is a personal knowledge vault designed to support my study and certification as an **AWS Certified Solutions Architect**, using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for structured, interlinked note-taking.

It is built to complement the [AWS SkillBuilder](https://skillbuilder.aws) coursework, real-world architecture patterns, and exam preparation strategies. Notes are organized by AWS domains and services, with templates, integration links, and embedded practice questions.
